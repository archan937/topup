<%= h1 "What is TopUp?" %>
<p>
  TopUp is an easy to use Javascript library for unobtrusively displaying images and webpages in a Web 2.0 approach of popups.
  The library is <%= link_to "jQuery", "http://jquery.com" %> and <%= link_to "jQuery UI", "http://jqueryui.com" %> driven in order to maintain cross-browser compatibility and compactness.
  TopUp offers the following advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>TopUp is absolutely free, also for commercial use (view the <%= link_to "license", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0" %>)</li>
  <li>A very easy setup process (only one <%= link_to "include", documentation_path(:anchor => "installation") %> and nothing more)</li>
  <li>Using <%= link_to "TopUp presets", examples_path(:anchor => "grouped_links") %> keeps your HTML code 100% clean, no extra code needed whatsoever</li>
  <li>The ability of displaying images, flash (from sites like Youtube, SWF and FLV files), movies (QuickTime, Windows Media and Realplayer), iframes, DOM elements and raw HTML</li>
  <li>TopUp can be used along with <%= link_to "Prototype", "http://prototypejs.org" %> (just include TopUp before Prototype)</li>
  <li>TopUp is compressed with <%= link_to "Yahoo! YUI Compressor", "http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" %> to <%= number_to_human_size File.size("#{RAILS_ROOT}/assets/releases/latest/top_up-min.js") %> (includes JS, HTML and CSS)</li>
  <li>Usage of CSS sprites to reduce the amount of image requests to two per layout for <%= link_to "faster loading", "http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html" %></li>
  <li>Cross-browser compatibility</li>
  <li>Fancy layouts, animations and transitions</li>
  <li>Auto-correction of size and position when required</li>
  <li>The possibility to create groups</li>
  <li>Support for AJAX requests</li>
  <li>It's open source: check out <%= link_to "http://github.com/archan937/topup", "http://github.com/archan937/topup" %> and enhance TopUp yourself!</li>
  <li>And many more...</li>
</ul>

<%= h1 "Why another Lightbox-like Javascript library?" %>
<p>
  Just like many among us, I had the need for a lightbox-like library to use for a website I was working on.
  After examining libraries such as <%= link_to "Lightbox", "http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/" %>, <%= link_to "Lightbox2", "http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/" %>, 
  <%= link_to "LightWindow", "http://stickmanlabs.com/lightwindow/" %>, <%= link_to "Highslide", "http://highslide.com/" %>, <%= link_to "Thickbox", "http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/" %>, 
  <%= link_to "ModalBox", "http://www.wildbit.com/labs/modalbox/" %> and many more, I haven't found one that really suited my needs. Either the installation was to complicated, 
  they aren't unobtrusive because you have to mess with the HTML code, the appearance isn't that slick, the transitions were glitchy, conflicts with other libraries occured 
  or the possibilities were lacking.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Enter TopUp!</strong> The installation of TopUp consists of including only one file (<strong>no images or stylesheets!</strong>), the look-and-feel is Apple-like, the animations 
  and transitions look fancy, you can still use Prototype, it is so easy to specify options and last but not least: you can stay updated with the latest version without changing any code.
  Great for expansions and bugfixes!
